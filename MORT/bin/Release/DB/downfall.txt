Polish born, self-taught game designer. Spent 13 years in England, working mostly in hotels, nursing homes and hospitals, and making his first two games in his spare time, between family life and jobs, sometimes late into the night... With the release of the original Downfall in 2009 he saw there are people out there who like what he does. With the success of The Cat Lady in 2012 he was eventually able to start a new life back in his hometown and work on games full-time.

His real name is Michal Michalski. He's Rem's older brother and inspiration. Though he'd received proper musical education in his youth, he works in a completely different field now and is very successful in what he does. Micamic, pronounced ''mitz-a-mitz'', has always produced music for his brother Rem and supported him in his career. And it's not looking like it will change any time soon...

Stefano finds a 'sentient living being' the best way to describe him. When Rem was looking for an animator for Downfall he put his hand up and was instantly hired for the job. But his input has gone way beyond that. He gave Downfall's characters a new look and a new soul. In a very professional manner. Stefano, also known as Yeppoh, has worked on many projects, including Broken Sword 5 and So Blonde, as well as his own upcoming Nefasto's (mis)adventures: Meeting Noeroze.

Warmer is the musical solo project of Jesse Gunn. And Jesse is a young man with passion for music and video games. He played the original Downfall back in the day and got in touch with Rem. They've been friends ever since. Jesse's music directly influenced The Cat Lady, as many scenes were actually created AROUND his music. For the role of Joe Davis, he was an obvious choice for Rem. Warmer's new album Decisions has been released alongside Downfall. Go find it.

IAMQQQQQQQ is a strange, strange man... Hidden in shadows, he lives a life of a vampire, walking streets of his city at night, leaving mysterious items he calls 'artifacts' in hard to find places. He dropped his real name a long time ago. These days he's more of a secret presence, both in real world as the internet. He made several music tracks for The Cat Lady and Downfall remake. It's those deep dark ambient drones you can hear in the game sometimes. That's him.

One of the five Orsie brothers. They used to have a band called Tears Of Mars. Siah has been a good friend to Rem since The Cat Lady days. His song used for the ending credits hit just the right note. His music can be heard in Downfall too, both during the intro and one of the endings. Siah is a great guy. A gifted musician. And a wonderful dad.

Rem found them on Bandcamp and fell in love with some of their songs. So he reached out and asked them if he could use their music for the game and it turned out they're really cool about it. And that they are gamers too! With charismatic singer/pianist Elisa Zoot at the front, Black Casino And The Ghost are the rising stars of London alternative rock scene.

Ben and Alfie Weedon are brothers from Somerset. They make this cool acoustic blend of folk and classical music. Their song 27 years was used for one of the Cat Lady trailers. This time they'd offered to record something just for the game... So Rem described the scene and they delivered a perfect piece. Their track plays early in the game, when Joe and Ivy argue in the hotel bedroom.

He works as an executive producer under the Screen7 label, meaning he takes care of all the PR, business stuff and finding most of the actors (it's him who discovered Lynsey 'Susan Ashworth'  Frost). But most of all, he's a friend, and Rem couldn't have taken his games to where they got without him. He's got his insecurities and hardly looks the part of the big businessman... but they based their co-operation on trust and honesty, and that's why it works so well.
