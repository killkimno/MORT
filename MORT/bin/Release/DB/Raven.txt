Wachmann
/t

/e


/s
He's guarding something.
/t
뭔가를 지키고 있는 중이다.
/e


/s
I think you're guarding something.
/t
내 생각에 뭔가를 지키고 있는거 같은데요.
/e


/s
Oh really? And what might it be?
/t
흠 그래요? 그래 뭘 하고 있다고 생각하시는데요?
/e


/s
He's searching for someone.
/t
누군가를 찾고 있는 중이다.
/e


/s
I think you're looking for someone.
/t
제 생각에는 누군가를 찾고 있는거 같군요.
/e


/s
disappointed
/t
실망 스럽군.
/e


/s
You're just guessing.
/t
추측일 뿐이잖아.
/e


/s
If I were looking for someone, I wouldn't spend the trip cooped up in a freight car, now would I?
/t
내가 누군가 찾는다면 화물칸에서나 시간을 허비하고 있진 않을거라네.
/e


/s
slightly ashamed
/t
당황스럽다.
/e


/s
Well that would seem to indicate that you're guarding something.
/t
자네가 뭔가를 지키는 것 처럼 보이는군.
/e


/s
And what might it be?
/t
그리고 무엇을 할 수 있지요?
/e


/s
He's on holiday.
/t
그는 쉬는날 입니다.
/e


/s
slightly sarcastic
/t
좀 비꼬다.
/e


/s
I think we can rule out that you're on holiday.
/t
내 생각엔 자네가 휴일인건 좀 배제했으면 하는군.
/e


/s
strictly, upset
/t
화가났다.
/e


/s
I don't have time for fun and games!
/t
장난칠 시간 없다네!

So?
/t
그래서?

A jewel

보석

played innocent
/t
무한 재생
/e


/s
Could it possibly be...a jewel that's making a long and perilous journey?
/t
보석이라... 보석 때문에 그렇게 위험하고 긴 모험을 했을까?
/e


/s
You're guessing. You can't possibly know what's inside the safe.
/t
자네 추측일 뿐이네. 내부에 뭐가 안전한지도 제대로 모르잖아.
/e


/s
But if that were the case?
/t
하지만 이런 경우라면?
/e


/s
Then I'd ask you why the train wasn't crawling with police...
/t
뭐 하나 묻고 싶군. 왜 주위에 경비원이 없는건지...
/e


/s
Whatever is inside the safe
/t
뭐 어쨌든 내부는 안전합니다.
/e


/s
I really couldn't say. But it must be very important.
/t
더이상 할 말 없군. 하지만 중요한게 있지.
/e


/s
Why's that?
/t
무엇입니까?
/e


/s
Because YOU are very important. They wouldn't have assigned the case to you if it were just a trifle.
/t
자네 자네 말이야. 이게 단순한 일이라면 자네를 대려오지도 않았을거라네
/e


/s
Let's assume that we really are transporting something 'very important' on this train. And let's assume that it really is my job to see that it arrives safely.
/t
한 번 이야기 해보자고, 우리가 운반하고 있는 요것이 '정말 중요한' 것이라면 말이야 자네가 과연 안전하다고 할 수 있을까?
/e


/s
Then why isn't the train crawling with police?
/t
그래서 왜 주위에 경비원이 전혀 없는겐가?
/e


/s
Money
/t
돈
/e


/s
Hmm. We're in Switzerland, a safe was loaded aboard... Perhaps it's full of money?
/t
흠 스위스에 왔군... 금고에는 돈이 가득 든건가?
/e


/s
piqued played
/t
감정을 상하게 하다
/e


/s
Oh, come now.
/t
아, 제발.
/e


/s
You really think that I - I, of all people - would be minding a pile of money? And in Switzerland, of all places?
/t
생각좀 해보라고, 스위스라고 해서 사람들이 쌓여 있는 돈을 신경 안 쓸거 같아?
/e


/s
No... So what is it that I'm guarding?
/t
엄 아뇨... 그래서 제가 뭘 지키면 되나요
/e


/s
It's a trap
/t
함정입니다.

It's... It's a trap!

Ha! You've got a vivid imagination, I'll give you that!
/t
하! 자네 한 상상력 하는군 이거나 먹게!
/e


/s
Don't arouse attention
/t
관심을 자극하지 않는다.
/e


/s
You don't want to arouse attention.
/t
별로 관심받고 싶지 않군요.

Evident. But why not?

분명해. 하지마 왜?
/e

More men are unnecessary
/t
더 많은 사람이 필요하지 않음
/e


/s
There are enough police on this train as it is. If there were more they'd only get in each other's way.
/t

/e


/s
seriously
/t

/e


/s
I can assure you that I'd pack every seat in every carriage of this train with police if it were a matter of deterrence.
/t

/e


/s
uncomprehendingly
/t

/e


/s
You're saying you DON'T want to scare off potential thieves?

surprising, got the clue

/s
You're laying a trap!

/e


/s
flirts
/t

/e


/s
That would explain why it's just me and not the army, n'est-ce pas?
/t

/e


/s
All the same, I can't comment on your speculation.
/t

/e


/s
What's going on here?
/t

/e


/s
But Monsieur! Your journey on this train is most unusual.
/t

/e


/s
Is it related to the burglary at the British Museum?
/t

/e


/s
wiegelt ab
/t

/e


/s
Not in the least.
/t

/e


/s
And the safe? What's that for?
/t

/e


/s
I'll let you know if we need your help, constable?
/t

/e


/s
I would like to help!
/t

/e


/s
irritated, outraged easily
/t

/e


/s
But Monsieur!
/t

/e


/s
Surely I can be of assistance somehow! I saw a safe being loaded...
/t

/e


/s
We have everything under control.

Burglary in London

You do know  these days there are thieves far more dangerous than your old Raven?

There was an explosion! A guard was severly injured.

Really?

tells vivid and exciting
/t

/e


/s
Ja. And do you know what the papers say?
/t

/e


/s
He should go away
/t

/e

Disturbing a Swiss officer while he reads a crime novel is a very serious offence!
/t
범죄 소설을 읽고 있는 스위스 장교를 건드는 것 만큼 위험한 건 없지 꼬마야!
/e


/s
I could arrest you.
/t
널 체포할 수 있단다.
/e


/s
But I have a pistol and you don't!
/t
하지만 피스톨도 없으면서요!
/e


/s
Who is he?
/t
누구니?
/e


/s
Where in the world is it so dangerous that I'd need a pistol? And who might you be?
/t
권총을 소지할 만큼 위험한 곳이 어디에 있니? 꼬마가 그런 세상을 만들고 있구나?

What's your name, boy?

My name is Matthew Miller!

And where are you from, Matthew Miller?

Impressive! You've already seen half the world.

I've spent my entire life in Switzerland.

Yes.

And why do you need a gun?
/t

/e

And what's with the gun? What do you need it for?
/t

/e


/s
Why do you need the gun?
/t

/e


/s
It's the Raven! He was gunned down. So now I need a pistol!
/t

/e


/s
Dead birds don't need guns... Nor do live ones.
/t

/e


/s
outraged
/t

/e


/s
You don't know who the Raven is, do you?
/t

/e


/s
He's the greatest burglar ever! He stole paintings from the Louvre. And those priceless eggs with the gold and diamonds and stuff.
/t

/e


/s
And Bobby Dobbs says he replaced the crown jewels with rhinestones!
/t

/e


/s
I know who the Raven was.
/t

/e


/s
Although... I don't quite buy that bit about the crown jewels.
/t

/e


/s
Do you want to learn about the game controls (Tutorial)?
/t

/e


/s
No, I'm good.
/t

/e


/s
Yes, tell me more.
/t

/e


/s
To examine an item, just click on it. Click on the sandwich paper on the table.
/t

/e


/s
If you move the mouse over the sandwich paper again, you'll see that the cursor's shape has changed and the text at the bottom of the screen says ''Take the sandwich paper''. Click again to pick it up.
/t

/e


/s
Very good. Move the cursor to the bottom of the screen. That's where the inventory is. In it you can see all the items that Constable Zellner is carrying. Left-click on the sandwich paper.
/t

/e


/s
Now you can use the sandwich paper with other objects. Move it over the apple core on the table and left-click.
/t

/e


/s
Open the inventory again and right-click on the sandwich paper.
/t

/e


/s
Of course, you can also use the items inside the inventory with each another. Left-click on the paper napkin and then click on the sandwich paper in the inventory.
/t

/e


/s
Let's get rid of it. Dump the litter from your inventory into the ashtray on Zellner's table.
/t

/e


/s
That wasn't too hard, was it? And now you know everything you need to know about the game's controls. Have fun!
/t

/e


/s
To examine an item move next to it with the left stick, use the right stick to select it and press $primary. Select the sandwich paper on the table.
/t

/e


/s
If you select the sandwich paper again, you'll see that the symbol displayed has changed and the text at the bottom of the screen says ''Take the sandwich paper''. Press $primary to pick it up.
/t

/e


/s
Very good. Now press $inventory. This opens the inventory, in which you can see all the items that Constable Zellner is carrying. Use the left stick to select the sandwich paper and press $primary, so that it is displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
/t

/e


/s
Now you can use the sandwich paper with other items. Select the apple core on the table and press $primary.
/t

/e


/s
Open the inventory again, select the sandwich paper and press $secondary to examine it.
/t

/e


/s
Of course, you can also use the items inside the inventory with each other. Select the paper napkin with $primary and then select the sandwich paper in the inventory with $primary.

I was so excited this morning that I couldn't eat anything. Needless to say, the second I got on the train I was famished.
/t

/e

Fortunately, I'd brought an apple.

/t

/e

This morning I thought I wouldn't be hungry because of all the excitement.  Thankfully I brought a sandwich with me anyway.
/t

/e


/s
[Ohi takes the sandwich paper, crumpled it and put it in his pocket.]
/t

/e


/s
[Ohi pulls out the paper, fold it in an easy and puts the apple in the paper. Then he crumples it up and puts it back]
/t

/e


/s
I wrapped the apple core in the sandwich paper. That way, I can carry it without making a mess of my trouser pocket.
/t

/e


/s
Still, I'd prefer not to have to carry them all day.
/t

/e


/s
The napkin came with the croissant I bought at the train station. A guilty pleasure. I don't need that either.
/t

/e


/s
[Ohi takes out the napkin and the greaseproof paper and crumples the two together. He stops with the garbage in his hand. In the inventory the greaseproof paper with the apple and the rest napkin combined into a new object called 'garbage'.]
/t

[Ohi throws the garbage in the garbage can.]

But... It'd be better if you'd...remain seated and...keep an eye on things.
/t

/e


/s
Your deductive powers leave much to be desired. I think we'll get along fine without you.
/t

/e


/s
Well... That is impressive, I admit. But the fewer people involved, the better. We'll get along fine without you.

Hmm. Clever and stubborn.

Your commitment speaks volumes, Zellner.

Fffff.

/s
[Scene: We see a paperback that Ohi holds relatively close to his face (because it's so exciting),  in close-up. This is the book 'The vicarage in the mirror' from 'Clarissa Westmacott'.]

Hands up!

손들어!

[Ohi irritated takes the book down a bit and look at the boy. He lowers not only up to the chest and remains seated otherwise. He wants to not really be bothered and would rather read on. Idle as he sits there.]

[Scene: The camera is initially on Ohis face in close-up. Then a cut and you can see that Ohi is in a police uniform and a little boy in front of him with a wooden gun stands]
/t

/e


/s
[Idle from boy as he aims his gun at Ohi.]
/t

/e


/s
[Ohi breathes lightly annoyed and,  while he looks further at the boy. When he is thinking,  'Is that really necessary?' Then he looks to the left and right,  whether guardians are seen,  which can take the boy. Nobody there. Back in the idle.]

/s
I don't have time to play. I'm on duty.

일하고 있는 중이란다.

[Director: Cut back on Ohi.]
/t

/e


/s
[Ohi still looks strictly over the book edge. Then he lets the book fall fast forward a little, so you can see his mouth. He sticks his tongue out to the boy and makes a grimace. He quickly hides again behind his book.]

[Ohi lowers the book,  puts it on his desk and goes into the 'talk with the boy' Idle.]

If you'll excuse me, I'll be in the first freight car at the back of the train for the rest of the trip.

Thanks to to that?

[Ohi goes a few steps towards the investigators, so they returned to normal conversational distance to each other.]
/t

/e


/s
eagerly
/t

/e


/s
I watched the people on the platform in Zurich!
/t

/e


/s
eagerly
/t

/e


/s
I know, for example, that that man over there is a violinist.
/t

/e


/s
[Scene: The investigator glances for violinists.]
/t

/e


/s
That would be more impressive if there weren't a violin case next to him.
/t

/e


/s
[The investigator turns around and wants to leave.]
/t

/e


/s
And I believe that the gentleman in the next carriage is a German doctor on his way to Italy to take up a new position.
/t

/e


/s
[Scene: The investigators thinks for a moment. Then he turns around.]
/t

/e


/s
curious
/t

/e


/s
And what gives you that idea?
/t

/e


/s
eager, hopeful
/t

/e


/s
There's the rod of Asclepius engraved on his cufflink. And he's carrying a German-Italian dictionary.
/t

/e


/s
Maybe he's just taking a holiday in Italy? Following in Goethe's footsteps?
/t

/e


/s
Too much luggage.
/t

/e


/s
[Scene: The investigator wants to interject something, but Ohi interrupts him]
/t

/e


/s
And no, he's not retiring to Italy either.
/t

/e


/s
The suitcases are too shabby for me to believe that he can afford to retire in his late fifties.
/t

/e


/s
[Scene: The investigator thinks for a moment.]

/s
All right, then, Constable...

If you're such a clever fellow... What am I doing on this train?

[Ohi turns disappointet ... and solidifies. Then he goes into the normal idle. Before him stands the smiling boy with his hands on his hips.]

embarrassed
/t

/e


/s
Oh... Hello!
/t

/e


/s
reproachful
/t

/e


/s
You cheated.
/t

/e


/s
uncomprehendingly
/t

/e


/s
I did what?
/t

/e


/s
reproachful
/t

/e


/s
I saw you talking to the German doctor on the platform.
/t

/e


/s
[Ohi feels uncomfortable in his own skin, looking around maybe if he is observed.]
/t

/e


/s
reproachfully
/t

/e


/s
He told you everything himself and you were just pretending to put two and two together.
/t

/e


/s
caught
/t

/e


/s
And what of it!
/t
